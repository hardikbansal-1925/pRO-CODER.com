                    (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign)[b] is a
                    general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped,
                    imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented
                    programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET
                    initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO
                    (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler
                    and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common
                    Language Infrastructure (CLI).

                    C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen.
                    The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3
