                <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base" style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px;">PHP is a general-purpose scripting language that
                    is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
                    Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP
                    originally stood for Personal but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
                    Preprocessor.

                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon
                    or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted
                    and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
                    would form the whole or part of a HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content
                    management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the
                    generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the
                    web context, such as standalone graphical applications[10] and robotic drone control.Arbitrary
                    PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via command-line interface (CLI).

                    The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP
                    License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every
                    operating system and platform, free of charge.

                    The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the
                    original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow.
                    Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p>
